# To-do list application

Application built using typescript and some html, boostrapped with Create Snowpack App (CSA).

This project isn't intended to be anything more than some things I did to start learning typescript. I'll probably enhance the html and functionality over time as I learn more ðŸ™‚.

## Commands

- `npm start` starts the app in development mode (open http://localhost:8080 to view it in the browser). Reloads on edit.
- `npm build` builds a static copy of the site to the `build/` folder.

## Future ideas to enhance this

- Better display
- Deletion of local storage
- Task categories (e.g. work or home)
- Deadlines
- Multi-user, authentication, permanent database storage, docker etc etc.
